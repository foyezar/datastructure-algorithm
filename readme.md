# 04 Problem Solving Patterns

## How to Improve?
1. Devise a plan for solving problems
2. Master common problem solving patterns

## Some Patterns...
* Frequency Counter
* Multiple Pointers
* Sliding Window
* Divide and Conquer
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy Algorithms
* Backtracking
* Many more!

### I. Frequency Counters
* This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of vlaues
* This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays/strings

Example1: Write a function called same, which accepts two arrays. The function should return true if every value in the array has it's corresponding vlaue squared in the second array. The frequency of values must be the same. (Same frequency)

Example2: Given two strings, write a function to determine if the second string is an anagram of the first. An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as cinema, formed from iceman. (ANAGRAMS)
